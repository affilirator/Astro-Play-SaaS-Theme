      "I recently got my hands on Flowbite Pro, and holy crap, I'm speechless with how easy this was to integrate within my application. Most templates are a pain, code is scattered, and near impossible to theme.",
      "Flowbite has code in one place and I'm not joking when I say it took me a matter of minutes to copy the code, customise it and integrate within a Laravel + Vue application.",
      "If you care for your time, I hands down would go with this.",

From the most used UI components like forms and navigation bars to the whole app screens designed both for desktop and mobile, this UI kit provides a solid foundation for any project.",
      "Designing with Figma components that can be easily translated to the utility classes of Tailwind CSS is a huge timesaver!",
