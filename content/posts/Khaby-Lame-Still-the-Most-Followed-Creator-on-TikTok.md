title: Khaby Lame Still the Most Followed Creator on TikTok
---

Khaby Lame, the Senegalese-Italian TikTok sensation, continues to reign supreme as the most followed creator on the platform in 2024.

With over 162 million followers, Lame has maintained his position at the top, significantly ahead of his closest competitor, Charli D'Amelio, who boasts approximately 155 million followers. 

This remarkable achievement underscores Lame's unique appeal and the enduring popularity of his content, which humorously critiques impractical life hacks without uttering a single word.

## The Rise of Khaby Lame

Lame's journey to TikTok stardom began in 2020 when he started posting videos that dissected convoluted life hacks. His signature style—silent reactions paired with simple solutions—quickly resonated with audiences worldwide. 

By July 2022, he surpassed D'Amelio to become the platform's most-followed creator, a title he has held ever since. In the past year alone, Lame has added about 2 million followers, showcasing his sustained relevance in an ever-changing social media landscape.

## Engagement and Popularity

Despite his massive follower count, Lame ranks lower in terms of total likes on TikTok, sitting at 2.4 billion likes—a stark contrast to D'Amelio's 11.7 billion likes. This discrepancy highlights a fascinating aspect of TikTok engagement; while follower counts are impressive, likes often indicate deeper audience interaction and loyalty. 

Nonetheless, Lame's ability to maintain a substantial following while focusing on a minimalist approach to content creation sets him apart in a platform often dominated by flashy visuals and elaborate storytelling.

## Earnings and Brand Collaborations

Lame's financial success is equally impressive. Forbes estimates his income at around $16.5 million from June 2023 to September 2024, with earnings per post reaching approximately $750,000 for brand promotions on TikTok and Instagram. His ability to command such high fees reflects not only his popularity but also his effectiveness as a marketing tool for brands looking to engage younger audiences.

## Stability Among Top Creators

The top five most followed TikTokers have seen little change in 2024, with Lame and D'Amelio leading the pack. Other notable figures include MrBeast and Bella Poarch, both of whom have climbed the ranks in recent months, while Addison Rae has slipped to fifth place. This stability suggests that while new creators may emerge, established influencers like Lame and D'Amelio continue to dominate due to their strong personal brands and consistent content output.

## The Future of TikTok

As Lame enjoys continued success, the future of TikTok itself remains uncertain. The platform faces potential regulatory challenges in the U.S., with President Joe Biden mandating ByteDance (TikTok's parent company) to divest by January 2025 or risk a ban. This looming deadline adds an element of unpredictability that could impact creators and brands alike.

## Conclusion

Khaby Lame's status as the most followed creator on TikTok in 2024 exemplifies the power of authenticity and simplicity in content creation. His unique approach not only entertains millions but also drives significant engagement for brands seeking to leverage influencer marketing effectively. As the landscape evolves, it will be intriguing to see how both Lame and TikTok navigate the challenges ahead while continuing to captivate audiences worldwide.
